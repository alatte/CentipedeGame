Centipede is a vertically oriented fixed shooter arcade game produced by Atari, Inc. in June 1981.
In my version, the player is a spaceship at the bottom of the screen that can shoot at centipedes (spaceships with a trailer), ants (another spaceship) and mushrooms (really mushrooms, not spaceship).
Although the player must protect mushrooms according to the game's instruction manual, but something went wrong. The player can get bonuses from every destroyed mushroom.
The goal of the player is get rid of centipedes and not to die.
